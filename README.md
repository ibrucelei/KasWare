Welcome to KasWare's Documentation.
## Quick Start
Click the [Download](www.baidu.com) button, which will take you to the chrome store to download the extension. 
## Address Types
972 and 111111 are coin types (they are different for historical reasons)

KDX/Kaspanet Web Wallet uses m/44'/972/0' derivation path (with 12 word seed phrases)

The Core Golang cli wallet and Kaspium uses m/44'/111111'/0' (with 24 word seed phrases)

For KasWare Wallet users, we strongly suggest choosing 111111 coin type, which is the default coin type when creating a new wallet with KasWare Wallet.

IMPORTANT: KDX wallets are not BIP-32 compatible, so KDX derivation path is supported but is considered deprecated.
